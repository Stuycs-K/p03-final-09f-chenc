### 1/6/25

Set up the "skeleton" of the program. Basically just set up the server socket creation and handshake. Also added rudimentary handling of different requests (just GET requests for now), but that will be rewritten and expanded later. Took around ~2 hours, mostly due to writing small errors that broke everything later on.
